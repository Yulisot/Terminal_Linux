# Terminal_Linux
This C code allows the user to enter shell commands and executes them in a separate process. It does this by using the fork() system call to create a child process, which then runs a loop where it prompts the user to enter a command, parses the command into separate arguments, and attempts to execute the command using the execv() system call. If the command cannot be found in any of the directories listed in the PATH environment variable, the program prints an error message. The parent process waits for the child process to finish executing before printing a message indicating that the command was executed in a separate process.
